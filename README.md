hello this is my first C project(neofetch copy)

## what is this project about

this is simple minimalist neofetch copy. It doesn't have distro logos, and now im know how to use popen but i dont wanna write millions lines of code to add logos. Sorry, im lazy *("-_-)*

## how to install it

`gcc cfetch.c -o cfetch`

and then

`su -c cp cfetch /usr/bin/cfetch`

in freebsd you need to install freecolor by writing `su -c pkg install freecolor`
